File explaining the internal design of zombi. It is currently a
draft. It is meant for the developers of zombi, and should probably by
used as a basis for documentation for users of zombi.

One of the first principle of zombi is to not mess up the source
directory. For that, we use the same principle as in ocamlbuild and
others: a separate build directory (it might be called _build in what
follow.)


All the rules are meant to act uniquely in the build dir with two
exceptions:

- The external dependencies. One can specify dependencies on an
  external library. Say your program uses Batteries. You want it to be
  rebuilt every time Batteries changes, so a dependency should be
  added. But it's not a classical one since it does not ask the build
  system to build nor import Batteries. I don't know yet how those
  external dependencies are specified

- The import rule. At first, the _build dir is empty, and must be
  populated, typically from files in the source dir. See separated
  file for the import rule.





Quick notes:

for rules, two categories of dependencies: blocking and optional:

- Blocking dependencies block the execution of the rule if they can't
  be built. Example: to build a .cmo file, the corresponding .ml file
  is a blocking dependency


Need a way to "accumulate" dependencies.


We need an exclusion clause in rules:
In caml, you can obtain a .cmi file:

- From a .mli file, with ocamlc -c or ocamlopt -c

- From a .ml file, IF NO .MLI FILE EXISTS with ocamlc -c (producing a
  .cmo file at the same time) or with ocamlopt -c, producing a .cmx
  and .o file

So we need the following rules:

%.mli -> %.cmi
%.ml & %.cmi -> %.cmo
%.ml - %.mli -> %.cmo & %.cmi
%.ml & %.cmi -> %.cmx & %.o
%.ml - %.mli -> %.cmx & %.cmi %.o





Rules should receive the dependence tree as argument. The reason is,
once again, because of ocaml (but probably also for C in fact):
